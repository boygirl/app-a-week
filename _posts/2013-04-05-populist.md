I know several people who live in, or who will be living in group housing situations, and they all seem to be plagued by communition issues. This is a tool that I hope will address those issues.

To start, I'm designing the social networking aspect to be contained within discrete communities. Individuals can't see each other until they're plugged into the same community. One of the first features I plan to build into the community are mass communication tools (IM/SMS/Email) that keeps all the community's correspondence in one place. After that, I'll be tackling collaboration features - blogging, threaded discussions, image or file sharing, google doc integration.

Further down the line, I'd like to make this a tool to allow individual communities to reach out to others over the interwabs. I can see this being particularly useful for small non-profit organizations as a means for multiple organizations to pool resources.

I'll be building this piece by piece as I improve my Rails-Fu. Give it a look and, if you're interested in adding to the project, by all means, feel free!
