### A Quick RSVP App in Rails

I finally got around to getting wedding invitations printed!  I decided to throw together a quick Rails app to collect RSVPs.  It's dead simple.  It collects RSVP information in a form, and emails the results to me.  It also emails guests a confirmation. I deployed it on heroku, and added a password, so robots wouldn't try to RSVP.

Here is a screen shot... Please don't crash my wedding.
