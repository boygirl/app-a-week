One busy afternoon when I should have been working on my class assignments, I was lazily browsing my Facebook's news feed when I noticed it was being overrun by all kinds of "Suggested" content. Suggested Posts, Suggested Pages, Suggested Events... simply ads redefined by some brooding and evil Facebook advertising manager.

After futzing around the settings searching in vain for a way to disable them, I decided to search for a software solution. There was only one: a Chrome extension with reviews complaining that it wasn't working.

What's a developer to do? Build his own solution of course! Introducing Unsuggest for Facebook, a Chrome extension that removes all the annoying Suggested Posts and Pages in your Facebook news feed!

If you're as annoyed as I am, [install the plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unsuggested-for-facebook/aafbgdfjkacljfjjnpoolgkgealgfjbp) and let me know how it works for you. I'd love to hear feedback!
